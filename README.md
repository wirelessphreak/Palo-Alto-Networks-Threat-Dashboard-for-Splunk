# Palo-Alto-Networks-Threat-Dashboard-for-Splunk
A Palo Alto Networks Threat Dashboard I built for Splunk. 

This is a firewall threat dahboard I built for Splunk and Palo Alto Network Firewalls. 
If you are logging your firewall threat logs to Splunk and you have the Palo Alto Netorks App or Splunk Add-On for Palo Alto Networks installed you should be good to go.


Directions:
1) Log into Splunk and go to Search
2) Click on Dashboards and Create a new Dashboard
3) Once you have created your new dashboard go to edit and select source tab on the top
4) Clear out the default text in the dashboard and copy and paste the dashboard from GitHub
5) Before you save the dashboard you will need to identify your Palo Alto firewall host= fields to populate the field2 drop down menus, I have space holders firewall-1, firewall-2, etc. configured currently

You should be good to go!
